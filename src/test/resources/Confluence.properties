Title=Atlassian Smoke Testing
Description=Pages and blog posts allow you to capture and share information in Confluence.Whether it's taking down some quick notes from a meeting, writing a requirements page, or letting your teammates know about the company's latest marketing push \u2013 you can create it as a Confluence page or blog post.Pages are great for when you want the information to last and evolve over time. If it's a point-in-time update or one-time communication then a blog post is the way to go. These aren't hard-and-fast rules; they're just pointers to give you a place to start.Each Confluence space, including your personal space, allows you to create pages in it, and has its own blog where you can create posts. If you're not sure what a space is, or what you can do with spaces, check out our page on Spaces.
